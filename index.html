      <div class="heading">Making Sense of Our Money System</div>
      <div class="text">
        Venmo is responsible for other people's money, so it is crucial that
        people understand how money operates within the Venmo ecosystem. Venmo
        is comprised of three different payment methods: bank accounts,
        debit/credit cards and Venmo balances. Depending on the scenario, there
        are different rules that apply to how money movement works. At a high
        level, money moves instantly on Venmo and transactions are free, unless
        you use a credit card or a debit card from a smaller bank.

      <div class="heading">The Problem</div>
      <div class="text">
        There are many nuances with Venmo’s payment methods relating to fees,
        timing, transferring to banks and type of payments (i.e. paying people
        or paying merchants). Our most frequent support cases come from issues
        related to our money system. In order to properly scope this project and
        not try to tackle a bunch of problems at once, we decided to focus on
        one task:
        <b class="italic"
          >make it easier to send and receive money on Venmo by simplifying the
          way one adds and manages banks and cards.</b

        We used an adaptation of Google Ventures

          >product design sprint</a
        >. This included phases for understanding the problem, diverging on
        solutions, deciding on solutions, prototyping and user testing. The
        project team consisted of an engineer, product manager and product
        designer. This was an accelerated project with the majority of the work
        completed within two weeks. There was a huge time constraint to ship the
        project because it directly affected another significant project that
        already had a firm deadline to ship.

      <div class="subheading marginTop1">Exploration</div>
      <div class="text marginTop1">
        After we were confident that everyone on the project team fully
        understood the problem that we were trying to solve, we created a user
        story (created based on our research and knowledge) that would guide the
        project. Then we moved on to Phase 2, “Exploration”. Phase 2 of the
        sprint began with a lot of white boarding and sketching. We aimed to
        generate as many ideas as possible, while keeping in mind the
        constraints that we defined during Phase 1.
      </div>
      <div class="text marginTop1">
        Below are sketches of ideas that came out during one session of Phase 2.
        Our sketches were very rough; it was really about brainstorming and not
        getting attached to a single idea.
      </div>
      <div class="text marginTop1">
        We took all of the ideas generated during Phase 2 and had mini-critiques
        on each of them. During Phase 3, we decided on which ideas to move
        forward with (i.e. prototype and user test) and which ones to discard.

      <div class="subheading">Prototyping and User Testing</div>
      <div class="text marginTop1">
        We are big proponents of making quick prototypes and getting it in front
        of people so that we can validate/test our ideas. For this project, I
        used a combination of Pixate and Invision to prototype full flows of our
        concepts and interactions. Building quick prototypes allowed us to get a
        better idea of how confident we were with a given solution.
      </div>
      <div class="text marginTop1">
        Below is an example of a prototype that we used during a user testing
        session. The user tests helped us identify three things: what we’re
        confident works, what we’re somewhat confident works and what we’re
        unsure of. Identifying “confidence levels” allowed us to recognize what
        needed more work.
      </div>
      <img src="assets/Prototype+1.png" />

      <div class="text marginTop1">
        After a round of testing, we found that people were having the most
        trouble understanding (i) the difference between a bank account and a
        card, and (ii) how Venmo balance works. In order to solve (i), we did
        more research and developed a ranking of what people tended to look for
        when identifying a card visually:
      </div>
      <ol class="list marginTop1">
        <li>Color and appearance of card <i>(Diagonal blue gradient)</i></li>
        <li>Product brand/name <i>(Chase Sapphire Preferred)</i></li>
        <li>Type of card <i>(Debit)</i></li>
        <li>Issuing Bank <i>(Chase)</i></li>
        <li>Network <i>(Visa)</i></li>
        <li>Last 4 <i>(**1234)</i></li>
      </ol>

      <div class="text">
        See below for an example of how we iterated on the visuals of this
        concept to help people understand the difference between a bank account
        and a card. (I understand that the 2nd iteration doesn't completely
        follow the ranked list above. This decision was made because of
        constraints at that time. This will be improved during a later phase of
        this project.)
      </div>
      <img src="./assets/image-asset(1).png" />
      <div class="text marginTop1">
        The 2nd iteration worked a lot better because the card was shaped like a
        card, and the bank was not. Also, people immediately saw the word
        “Debit” or “Credit” on the card image, and that helped people correctly
        associate the image with a card instead of a bank.
      </div>
      <div class="subheading marginTop1">Building It</div>
      <div class="text marginTop1">
        A dozen prototypes later, we finally had something that we felt
        confident about. At this point, it was time to polish UI elements and
        layouts. Also, because of the time constraint, we had to make some
        tradeoffs in order to hit the deadline. This meant making hard decisions
        to define what was required for the MVP.
        <div class="text marginTop1">Below is what shipped as the MVP.</div>
        <img class="marginTop1"src="./assets/image-asset(2).png"/>

        <div class="heading">Lessons Learned</div>
        <div class="text marginTop1">A byproduct of a project such as this is the broad impact on each user’s core experience with
            Venmo. We’re able to take what worked well, and what didn’t work so well, and apply it to
            future projects. We’ve also uncovered a lot of useful insights about people’s behaviors that we
            weren’t aware of previously. Here are a couple things that stood out to me during this project:
            When trying to explain a very complex system, it is worthwhile to think about simplifying the
            system, if at all possible and backed up with reason, rather than trying to explain all the
            nuances of such a system. Removing pieces of a system might rock the boat initially, but in the
            end, simplifying the model might cost less time and effort.</div>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>When trying to explain a very complex system, it is worthwhile to think about simplifying the
                    system, if at all possible and backed up with reason, rather than trying to explain all the

                    end, simplifying the model might cost less time and effort.
                </li>
                    <li>People like to focus on the task at hand. Anything not related to the task is secondary and tends
                        to be ignored. If my task is to “add a credit card to Venmo to use for future payments”, I’m
                        
                        going to have tunnel vision until that task is completed. For example, if I see copy trying to
                        explain a concept to me while I’m trying to complete a task, I’ll skim over it because it’s
                        secondary to the task at hand.
                    </li>
                        <li>
                            Security (perception and actual) always matters, no matter what the task is.
                        </li>
